    <b>not defined</b> - Any variable which we try to access but not declared will throw us a reference Error : variable not defined <br>
    <pre>console.log(myAge); // not defined</pre>

    <b>undefined</b> - If a variable is declared but not assigned  any value yet but we try to access that variable then we will get the error as undefined. <br>
    <pre>
        let myHobbies;
        console.log(myHobbies);
        myHobbies = "Carrom";
        console.log(myHobbies);
    </pre>

    <b>null</b> - Its a default value assigned by a user to the variable as long as the variable has not been assigned its original / updated value. <br>
    <pre>  
        let amIadult = null;
        console.log(amIadult);

        amIadult = true; //Boolean value
        console.log(amIadult);
    </pre>

    <b>Global Scope and Local/Block Scope</b> <br>
    <pre>
        let fname = "Hari";
        const lname = "Bajaj";
        var age = 29;

        console.log(fname, lname, age);
        <b><i>Anything which is declared outside local or block scope or outside curly braces is called global scope</i></b>
        {
             console.log(fname, lname, age);
        }

        console.log(fname, lname, age);
    </pre>

    <pre>
        <b><i>Anything which is inside between curly braces is called local/block scope.</i></b>
        {
            let fname = "Hari";
            const lname = "Bajaj";
            var age = 29;
            console.log(fname, lname, age);
        }
    </pre>

    In Global Scope generally we are not able to access block scope variables as long as there's let/const keywords, so it will give us a reference error : variable not defined.
    but for var we can access them even on global scope.
    <pre>
        console.log(fname);
        console.log(lname);
        console.log(age);
    </pre>


    <b>Hoisting</b> - Its only supported with that of var keywords and with the function. Let and const keywords do not support hoisting. <br>
    let keyword variables cannot be accessed before declaration or initialization. <br>
    <pre>
        //console.log(game);// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'game' before initialization.
        let game = "carrom";

        //console.log(game1);// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'game' before initialization.
        const game1 = "cricket";

        // var keyword variables are hoisted.
        console.log(game2);
        var game2;
        game2 = "Badminton";
        console.log(game2); //Badminton
    </pre>

    <b><i>Note - For var keyword variables, if we try to access them before assigning values to them will give us undefined but the moment we declare a value to it, it will give us the assigned value.</i></b> <br>
    <br>
    <b>Hoisting in functions</b> <br>

    <i>functions are hoisted because of which we can call the function before declaring the function.</i> <br>

    <pre>
        add(2,3);//arguments

        function add(a,b){
            let result = a+b;
            console.log(result);
            console.log("hello add function");
        }
